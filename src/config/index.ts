/**
 * @fileoverview Configuration Module Index
 *
 * This module serves as the main entry point for all configuration
 * related functionality. It re-exports configuration objects and
 * utilities from specialized modules.
 *
 * Modules:
 * - environment: Environment variable validation and parsing
 * - app: Application configuration factory and setup
 *
 * This modular approach separates concerns between environment
 * variable validation and configuration object creation, making
 * the codebase more maintainable and testable.
